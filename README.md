# Project 2 - 100 Mile Restaurant homepage

The goal of this project was to build a one page, mobile-first responsive site to match the provided design specifications. I used the bxSlider jQuery plugin for the image slider and and some code for smooth scrolling. The user is notified if the restaurant is open, based on the day of the week.
